  In this assignment the goal was to refactor the html and the css pages to make them more user friendly. 
  
  In the html page I added comments before each section to describe briefly what it was.  I replaced many "div" tags with more useful semantic tags that describes each part in more detail. For example, replacing a "div" tag with a "header", "nav", "article" or "section" tag and so on. For all of the images I gave an "alt" name for each one describing what was in the image. 
  In the css file I eliminated some repeating elements by grouping like ones together when I could. I made the css files elements correspond in the order that the html was in. In both files I tried to consolidate identical tags as much as I could along with eliminating unecessary spacing.
